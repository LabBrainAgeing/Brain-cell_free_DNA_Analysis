# Brain-cell free DNA Analysis
The analysis of plasma cfDNA is an emerging approach that allows to track cell death events in a minimally invasive way, also from inaccessible areas of the body like brain. DNA methylation (DNAm) profiles can be used to map the tissue of origin of cfDNA and to identify molecules released from brain upon cell death. 
Our laboratory developed an experimental and bioinformatic pipeline to identify
