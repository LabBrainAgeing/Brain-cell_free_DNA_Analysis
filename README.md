# Brain-cell free DNA Analysis
The analysis of plasma cfDNA is an emerging approach that allows to track cell death events in a minimally invasive way, also from inaccessible areas of the body like brain. DNA methylation (DNAm) profiles can be used to map the tissue of origin of cfDNA and to identify molecules released from brain upon cell death. 


Our laboratory developed an experimental and bioinformatic pipeline to identify

We used the Core 15-state model elaborated by the NIH Roadmap Epigenomics Con-sortium, in which 15 possible chromatin states are predicted on the basis of 5 histone modifications, and we compared the data from 7 brain regions with those from 34 non-brain tissues and primary cell lines
