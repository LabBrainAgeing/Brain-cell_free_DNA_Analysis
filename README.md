# Brain-cell free DNA Analysis
The analysis of plasma circulating cell-free DNA (cfDNA) is an emerging approach to track cell death events in a minimally invasive way, also from inaccessible areas of the body like brain. Previous studies showed that DNA methylation (DNAm) profiles can be used to map the tissue of origin of cfDNA and to identify molecules released from brain upon cell death.
